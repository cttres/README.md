# README.md
What most caught my attention is that with GitHub I can syncronize different devices and have my documents accesible from anywhere I want. I believe that function will be the one of most use for me. Also, as a record of my work and have a backup in case I need to go back or something messes up. The GitHub comminuty could be of big use too when needeing help, when feeling like helping someone, or maybe even challenges.

I don't believe I'm left with doubts or questions for now.
